At this time we have no specific documentation related to Intune and Insight setup. They can take a look at the documentation for the command line install options, but if they would like a more detailed guide/setup process you would need to point them toward pro services for that.

I appreciate this quote; I do need to make a coverage change for this coming year. We have changed our utilization of deep freeze on campus and now only need 300 units for the upcoming year. We will still need 125 insight units going forward. Can you rework the quote for this updated need?

to me, Benjamin, James, David

It not going to happen and I am sick and tired of this rushing. I have to do a DOA approval form completed as it is a 3 year contract. Please provide a 1-year quote.

Thanks

 

From the SSC

Good morning, David,

 

As this appears 3 year term, a DOA prepayment approval is required.

Once you have the approval, please send to me.

 

Thank you!

Thought of keeping you updated, the 30 grace period to renew has almost

By when can we expect your purchase order ?

Good afternoon Mike,


This just came in and I thought of sharing it with you.

Faronics is offering a 4% discount on the one year renewal term if we can
get your purchase order by January 31 - 2023. You can also renew by a
secured credit payment link which I would be happy to email you.


Please let me know in case you would like to take advantage of this, I
would be glad to email you an updated discounted quote.


Thank you.

Thought of keeping you updated, the 30 grace period to renew has almost
ended after which there would be a version upgrade fee in addition to the
maintenance cost increasing the overall cost by 4x.

By when can we expect your purchase order ?

Hi Aurora,

How are you?

I'm with the renewals team here at Faronics, and I'm writing to remind you
that the subscription of your 10 Deep Freeze licenses has expired on
January 16, 2023.

If you plan to continue enjoying all of the time and money-saving benefits
of Deep Freeze, then keeping maintenance current ensures you always have
free access to our latest versions, plus Premium Tech Support, and any bug
fixes.

I have attached a quote for your review and approval.

You will also find a convenient credit card authorization form on the last
page.

If you have any questions at all concerning the quote, please don't
hesitate to call me.

Kindly ignore if already renewed.

Hello William

I just wanted to highlight something that apart from the 6 DFE

There are other 8 DFS Licenses as well. The 8 Licenses are under

the name of Erik Goodman. Would You Like me to combine those and

have them under your name so you could renew all the licenses together

at the same time. ? Do let me know

*Thanks *

Hello William

I just wanted to highlight something that apart from the 6 DFE there are
other 8 DFS Licenses as well.

The 8 Licenses + 10 Licenses accounted for separately which are under the
name of Erik Goodman.

Would You Like me to combine those and have them under your name so you
could renew

all the licenses together at the same time. ?

Do let me know

Hi jared,

How are you?

I'm with the renewals team here at Faronics, and I'm writing to remind you
that the subscription of your 1 Deep Freeze licenses will expire on April
3, 2023.

If you plan to continue enjoying all of the time and money-saving benefits
of Deep Freeze, then keeping maintenance current ensures you always have
free access to our latest versions, plus Premium Tech Support, and any bug
fixes.

I have attached a quote for your review and approval.

You will also find a convenient credit card authorization form on the last
page.

If you have any questions at all concerning the quote, please don't
hesitate to call me.

Kindly ignore if already renewed.

Good afternoon Luis,


Thought of keeping you updated, the 30 grace period to renew has almost
ended after which there would be a version upgrade fee in addition to the
maintenance cost increasing the overall cost by 4x.

By when can we expect your purchase order ?


Thank you.

Hi Team,

 

Sorry for the rush- would you be able to send over renewal quote today? Customer needs to submit through purchasing and it could take few weeks so they want to make sure we get processed prior to expiration on 3/21.

 

Thank you!

Good afternoon Ronnie,


Thought of keeping you updated, the 30 grace period to renew has almost
ended after which there would be a version upgrade fee in addition to the
maintenance cost increasing the overall cost by 4x.

By when can we expect your purchase order ?


Thank you.

If you plan to continue enjoying all of the time and money-saving benefits

Hi William,

How are you?

I'm with the renewals team here at Faronics, and I'm writing to remind you
that the subscription of your 10 Deep Freeze licenses will expire on March
3, 2023.

If you plan to continue enjoying all of the time and money-saving benefits
of Deep Freeze, then keeping maintenance current ensures you always have
free access to our latest versions, plus Premium Tech Support, and any bug
fixes.

I have attached a quote for your review and approval.

You will also find a convenient credit card authorization form on the last
page.

If you have any questions at all concerning the quote, please don't
hesitate to call me.

Kindly ignore if already renewed.

Hi John

I don't know why you send a quote for only the 60 DFE licenses when the 60 Insight Licences for the same person expired on the same day.

I have added those Insight Licenses to the opp - please send a revised quote and let him know this one includes the Insight Licenses.

Please take care to observe these types of opps in the future.

Hi John

I don't know why you send a quote for only the 60 DFE licenses when the 60 Insight Licences for the same person expired on the same day.

I have added those Insight Licenses to the opp - please send a revised quote and let him know this one includes the Insight Licenses.

Please take care to observe these types of opps in the future.

Dennis

Hi Chris,

How are you?

I just left you a voicemail about your expired maintenance on 4 Deep Freeze Mac  licenses. Your  Maintenance Agreement actually expired in January.

If you plan to continue enjoying all of the the time and money-saving benefits of Deep Freeze, then keeping maintenance current ensures you always have free access to our latest versions, plus Premium Tech Support, and any bug fixes.

I have attached a quote showing options for 3 and 5 years of extended maintenance.  You renewed for 5 years last time.

You will find a convenient credit card authorization form on the 2nd page.

If you have any questions at all concerning the quote, please don't hesitate to call me.

Dennis

Hi Aaron,

How are you?

I'm with the renewals team here at Faronics, and I'm writing to remind you
that the subscription of your 2 Deep Freeze licenses has expired on
February 14, 2023.

If you plan to continue enjoying all of the time and money-saving benefits
of Deep Freeze, then keeping maintenance current ensures you always have
free access to our latest versions, plus Premium Tech Support, and any bug
fixes.

I have attached a quote for your review and approval.

You will also find a convenient credit card authorization form on the last
page.

If you have any questions at all concerning the quote, please don't
hesitate to call me.

Kindly ignore if already renewed.

Hi Catherine,

 

So I completely dropped the ball here. I think what happened was looking at the site and not seeing an actual quote. Can you please send me something that has the 330 Deep Freeze, 4 Deep Freeze Macs and 230 WINSelect all together?

 

Thanks

Kerri

Hi Elias,

How are you?

I'm with the renewals team here at Faronics, and I'm writing to remind you
that the subscription of your 15 Deep Freeze licenses will expire on March
15, 2023.

If you plan to continue enjoying all of the time and money-saving benefits
of Deep Freeze, then keeping maintenance current ensures you always have
free access to our latest versions, plus Premium Tech Support, and any bug
fixes.

I have attached a quote for your review and approval.

You will also find a convenient credit card authorization form on the last
page.

If you have any questions at all concerning the quote, please don't
hesitate to call me.

Kindly ignore if already renewed.

Hello Albert,

Development has yet to review the new Data set we received, that being said they are also wondering if you're open for another Remote session with them on it? Are you available later this week to get on a call?

Hello Albert,

Hope you're doing well, Development has had some time to Review your Data and it appears that we're missing some Data. Could you please re-run the Data Collection tool on the Machine with the Core Server one more time and upload it? If we still do not get the Data collection our developers would like to schedule another remote session with you.

Instructions below: 

 

In the process of troubleshooting your issue, it has become apparent that we need to collect some additional data from your client machine(s) or server(s) to get a better understanding of the issue that you are seeing.

 

To make this process as quick as possible we are asking that you download and run our Data Collection tool linked below;

 

https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/faronics-techsupport-utilities/Download/FaronicsDataCollectionTools.exe

 

The data collection tool will generate a ZIP file in the folder that you run it from. This file will be labeled with the name of the system that you are running it on and the date that the utility was run. I would ask you to upload the file to me at the URL below;

 

https://faronics.digitalpigeon.com/rcv/send

 

When uploading the data please ensure that you include the conversation number for this issue (28752)so that the upload can be quickly referenced back to this ticket. Not including the ticket reference number may result in the data being deleted immediately if we cannot link it to an existing ticket.

 

Our data collection tool will automatically extract and send us information about your system including, but not limited to;

 

·Faronics Product Information. (Configuration data, log files)

·Details on installed products, including product names, version numbers, and locations of files.

·Hardware statistics, including processor, hard disk, and other unique identifiers associated with your hardware. (MSINFO Report)

·Event, Application, and Security logs from the client machines.

·Copies of some Faronics files related to the configuration of your systems.

 

While we intend to only collect information relevant to the issue the nature of collecting data from your system in an automated manner may result in the collection of personally identifiable information.

 

All the information collected during this process will be handled per our Privacy Policy and all stipulations in GDPR Article 28(3) where we (Faronics) are the Data Processor and you are the Data Controller.

 

The data that we collect will only be used for purposes of troubleshooting your issue and will be retained for no more than three months. If there is a legitimate need to retain the data for a longer period our team will contact you to secure permission for us to do so.

 

If you have any concerns regarding this data collection please feel free to let us know or contact our data protection officer via email at dpo@faronics.com.

Best Regards,

Nikita Raguzin

Hello Albert,

We've received your Data Collection, we will update you as soon as we hear anything from Development. Please note, I forgot to mention we uninstalled the Faronics AV during our testing, to re-install it you can do so from the Deep Freeze Console just create a ""Work station Seed installer"" by going to ""Tools"" ->Configuration Administrator->""Create"" Button -> Create Workstation Seed Installer.

Just run this on the Machine after, it should show up in the Deep Freeze Console work station list inside the Deep Freeze Enterprise Console, you can then right click it and select ""Install"" for Anti-Virus.

Good afternoon Abdy,


Thought of keeping you updated, the 30 grace period to renew has almost
ended after which there would be a version upgrade fee in addition to the
maintenance cost increasing the overall cost by 4x.

By when can we expect your purchase order ?


Thank you.

Good afternoon Juan,


Thought of keeping you updated, the 30 grace period to renew has almost
ended after which there would be a version upgrade fee in addition to the
maintenance cost increasing the overall cost by 4x.

By when can we expect your purchase order ?


Thank you.

I will still need three SKUs for three different costs, can you advise those? Since two lines have the same cost we can use the same SKU.

 

 

TD Synnex system has limitations on SKUs/ cost. They cannot adjust one SKU for different costs.

Hello Denise 

I am Attaching an Updated rectified quote. Please disregard the Previous quote. 

As Far as SKU is concerned it is one and the same product in different quantities 
expiring on different dates. so the Part # or / SKU will not be different.

It'll be the same since it's just one product in 4 quantities originally expiring on different dates NOW co-termed.

Our current cost for this SKU is 10.40 USD from Faroincs.

 

Since none of the cost on this quote match that, can you advise NEW SKUs for each line?

 

TD Synnex cannot adjust the cost 4 x times for this one SKU on one reseller quote, does that make sense?

Co-terming will reduce the number of times they need to renew and track the Licenses. It'll help to renew all the Licenses at one time.

Hello Denise  

Hope You are well. 

Just wanted to clarify a couple of things before I send a renewal quote 
for SINAI HOSPITAL. I tried calling you  but I left a voicemail.

There are a couple of Licenses for Sinai Hospital expiring on different dates 
would You want me to co-term them together? 

Let me  know on this

Co-terming will reduce the number of times they need to renew and track the Licenses. It'll help to renew all the Licenses at one time. 

Also If You could check with the end user if they would like to renew all the Licenses or would wish to cut down on the number of licenses.

Good afternoon,

 

Thank you for the quote. I have attached the CC authorization form. Please note, we will need 4 licenses instead of the 2 listed on the quote.

 

Our only number is 800-455-5676. Unfortunately, I can sometimes be hard to get ahold of via phone as I am in a lot of meetings. I can generally respond much quicker via email.

 

Thanks,

Jeanette 😊

You need to  Rectify the Payment amount.

The costing of the two New Licenses will be informed to you by the sales team.

The renewal and issue of new License calculation is done differently.

I called Mystic & Noank  Library and briefly spoke to Chris, the director.

She hung up on me after saying it's working well.  

I noticed that their renewal comes up on the 5th and no one has sent a renewal quote yet.

Here's the opp still in Shawn's name - https://faronicsna.my.salesforce.com/006I9000002Hunq

Please send her one - I wouldn't bother calling.

Good afternoon Michael,


Thought of keeping you updated, the 30 grace period to renew has almost
ended after which there would be a version upgrade fee in addition to the
maintenance cost increasing the overall cost by 4x.

By when can we expect your purchase order ?


Thank you.

Subject: Problems with your product
To:


Good morning, you are wanting me to purchase again.
I have a huge problem with your standard deepfreeze.  
I bought a second copy to protect my simulator for user changes and I have to fix things on the sim regularly.
I use PROTON VPN and I set the login before I freeze the system.  When I go to use it looses the login and password.
I load up a plane in sim with parameters and then the plane doesn't remember.
what is going on? I dont care to waste more money having to do the same things as before I had your software.
I use win10, I7, nvidia 2080ti, 2 2tb drives, and 36gb memory.  Maybe this is the problem, I don't know.

Hello Marco

Hope You are well.

I am following up in regards to the maintenance renewal of the deep freeze
Licenses

wanting to let you know that the current price on the renewal is valid for
the next 18 days

Post which a Version Upgrade charge will be applied which is 4 times the
cost of the annual maintenance.

Perhaps you should consider the 3-year maintenance renewal at this time,
and avoid the renewal process altogether for 3 years,


while enjoying the benefits of full maintenance coverage, such as Premium
Tech Support, Bug Fixes, and free upgrades for our new releases.

Subject: Deep Freeze Maintenance Renewal Quotation
Body:
Hi Steve,

How are you?

This is a quick reminder that the maintenance on your 19 Deep Freeze Licenses is expiring on March 23.

I trust that Deep Freeze is still living up to your expectations?

When you purchased  last year, the maintenance was included as part of that purchase.
This year is your first opportunity to renew your maintenance package, so you may have some questions about the upcoming renewal.

Simply stated, keeping maintenance ​current is essential to achieve the absolute best results you can from the software. Why? Because with current maintenance you are always able to download any upgrades or changes to the software. Plus, you have telephone access to our expert and knowledgeable staff in tech support, and automatically receive any necessary bug fixes. Without maintenance, you have rights only to your current version.  In effect, maintenance protects your investment.

Please review the attached quote, with options for 1 and 3 years of extended maintenance. Note the discount when choosing the 3-year term.

Don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Good afternoon Marcus,

Hope this email finds you well.
Your Deep Freeze Enterprise annual maintenance would be expiring on
February 22 - 2023.
Would you like to renew directly through Faronics ? I see that last time
you renewed through CDW. In case you are planning to renew through CDW
could you help me out with the name and email address of your rep at CDW so
that I can email the quote.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you.

Good afternoon Ron,


This just came in and I thought of sharing it with you.

Faronics is offering a 6% discount on the three year renewal term if we can
get your purchase order by January 31 - 2023. You can also renew by a
secured credit payment link which I would be happy to email you.


Please let me know in case you would like to take advantage of this, I
would be glad to email you an updated discounted quote.


Thank you.

Thank you Abby!

 

Can you process the renewal on February 11, 2023 and just charge the AMEX card that you have on file?

 

By the way, my new business address is below. Please update your records. Thanks!
